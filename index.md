Welcome! 

I am an economic theorist focusing on the economics of information. I am currently a DPhil (PhD) student at the University of Oxford. 

I am on the <span style="color: #c00000;">2024 - 2025 Job Market</span>. Here is my [CV](docs/akkar_cv.pdf).

# Job Market Paper

**The (Mis)use of Information in Decentralised Markets** (coming soon!) <!-- [paper] [short talk] [long talk] -->

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>


  <br />
I study whether a decentralised market for a common value asset becomes more efficient with more information in the market, either through (i) more buyers, or (ii) better informed buyers. More information may help buyers screen the asset's value better and execute better trades. But it may also exacerbate adverse selection and push them to worse trades---there is greater downside to trading when others refused to. The <em>kind</em> of information buyers have determines which force prevails. Efficiency is eventually decreasing (increasing) in the number of buyers and converges to its lower (upper) bound when buyers’ signals have bounded (unbounded) likelihood ratio at the top. Unless <em>adverse selection is irrelevant</em>, efficiency decreases (increases) when buyers get a <em>positive (negative) override</em>---information which helps them reconsider a seller they would have rejected (traded with). For binary signals, this yields a sharp characterisation: stronger good news increase, but stronger bad news eventually decrease efficiency.

# Working Papers

**Capture-Resistant Committee Design** (coming soon!) <!-- [paper] [short talk] [long talk] -->

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  <br />  
A lobbyist wants to sway a committee towards implementing a policy by publicly designing and revealing the outcome of an experiment. Each committee member prefers to adopt the policy if the probability of its success exceeds her personal threshold. After the lobbyist reveals the outcome and before they vote, each committee member acquires additional---flexible and costly---private information about the chance of success. A <em>dictatorial</em> voting rule is optimal; it maximises the probability of adoption for a policy that will succeed, minimises it for a policy that will fail, and minimises every member’s information acquisition cost. The optimal dictator is <em>the most demanding member</em>---the member who would acquire the most evidence in favour of the policy before she implements it.

**Collusive College Admissions** (reach out for draft) <!-- [paper] [short talk] [long talk] -->

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

  <br />
I study a matching market á la Azevedo and Leshno (2016), with two colleges and a continuum of students. Students are vertically differentiated in their "promise"; both colleges prefer students with higher promise. Colleges are vertically differentiated over their (i) prestige and (ii) quality investments; students' preferences over these pairs are identical. Students face uncertainty over colleges' capacities. I show that the Boston mechanism might leave both colleges better off relative to a mechanism that produces the unique ex post stable outcome. The college with lower prestige benefits from an <em>allocative effect</em>: it attracts some promising students away from its rival by offering a safer bet. The college with greater prestige benefits from a <em>competitive effect</em>: by conceding those students to its rival, it attenuates competition for the most promising ones. I discuss how my finding can explain long-standing frictions in global college admission mechanisms.
